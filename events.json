structure.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Nerixyz/instagram_mqtt/issues/comments/1091908127/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-04-07T15:54:59Z"},{"id":"21168867142","type":"IssueCommentEvent","actor":{"id":84444757,"login":"Morniric","display_login":"Morniric","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Morniric","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/84444757?"},"repo":{"id":200295248,"name":"Nerixyz/instagram_mqtt","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Nerixyz/instagram_mqtt"},"payload":{"action":"created","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Nerixyz/instagram_mqtt/issues/96","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Nerixyz/instagram_mqtt","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Nerixyz/instagram_mqtt/issues/96/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Nerixyz/instagram_mqtt/issues/96/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Nerixyz/instagram_mqtt/issues/96/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Nerixyz/instagram_mqtt/issues/96","id":1195181882,"node_id":"I_kwDOC_BDUM5HPQc6","number":96,"title":"realtime

I be notified of new posts and stories? \r\nInstagram Android application lets users to get notifications about new posts and stories ([source](https://help.instagram.com/1687419104847502))\r\nI've reverse engineered Instagram Android application and found that when a user switches toggle buttons (`Posts`, `Stories`, `IGTV`, `Reels`) some requests have to be sent.\r\nExample (the request is sent when a user switches `Stories` button): \r\n```javascript\r\nconst { body } = await ig.request.send({\r\n    url: `/api/v1/friendships/favorite_for_stories/<target_id>/`,\r\n    method: 'POST',\r\n    form: ig.request.sign({\r\n        user_id: \"<target_id>\",\r\n        _uid: \"<subscriber_id (i.e. self user_id)>\",\r\n        _uuid: ig.state.uuid\r\n    })\r\n});\r\nconsole.log(body); // should print { 'status': 'ok' }\r\n```\r\nI've tried to subscribe for notifications after `auth` event, but after posting new story nothing happened. I copy/pasted [this example](https://github.com/Nerixyz/instagram_mqtt/blob/master/examples/push.example.ts) and added the code above after 29 line. \r\nIs it possible to be notified of new posts and stories using this library?
